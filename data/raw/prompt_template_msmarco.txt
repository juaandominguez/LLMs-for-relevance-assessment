Given a query and a web page, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 2 with the following meanings:

2 = highly relevant, very helpful for this query
1 = relevant, may be partly helpful but might contain other irrelevant content
0 = not relevant, should never be shown for this query

Assume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic.
If you would use any of the information contained in the web page in such a report, mark it 1. If the web page is primarily about the topic, or contains vital information about the topic, mark it 2. Otherwise, mark it 0.

A person has typed [<query>] into a search engine.

Consider the following web page.

—BEGIN WEB PAGE CONTENT—
<document_text>
—END WEB PAGE CONTENT—

Split this problem into steps:

Consider the underlying intent of the search.

Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M).

Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).

Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).

Produce a JSON object of scores without providing any reasoning. Example: {"M": 2, "T": 1, "O": 1}

{"M: : ...
