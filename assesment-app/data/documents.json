Products covered by this guidance should undergo one of the following processes:</p><p>Hot-Process Smoked or Hot-Process Smoke-Flavored Fish (Air Packaged)</p><p>Must be heated to a continuous internal temperature of at least 145°F (63°C) for a minimum of 30 minutes.Should be brined to contain at least 3.0% water-phase salt in the finished product, except for smoked chub containing sodium nitrite (as specified in §172.177 of this chapter), which must follow the process outlined in that section.</p><p>Hot-Process Smoked or Hot-Process Smoke-Flavored Fish (Vacuum, Modified, or Controlled Atmosphere Packaged)</p><p>Must be heated to a continuous internal temperature of at least 145°F (63°C) for a minimum of 30 minutes. Should be brined to contain at least 3.5% water-phase salt in the finished product, or 3.0% if sodium nitrite is present at not less than 100 ppm (as allowed by §§172.175 and 172.177). Cold-Process Smoked or Smoke-Flavored Fish (Air Packaged)</p><p>Must be brined or dry salted to contain at least 3.5% water-phase salt in the finished product. If sodium nitrite is present at 100 ppm or more, it should contain at least 3.0%. For fish that is frozen immediately after smoking and remains frozen throughout storage, a minimum of 2.5% water-phase salt is required. Cold-smoked fish should be processed under one of the following conditions: (i) Smoking chamber temperature does not exceed 90°F (32°C) for a period not exceeding 20 hours. (ii) Smoking chamber temperature does not exceed 50°F (10°C) for a period not exceeding 24 hours. (iii) For sablefish, the temperature does not exceed 120°F (49°C) for a period not exceeding 6 hours. Cold-Process Smoked or Smoke-Flavored Fish (Vacuum, Modified, or Controlled Atmosphere Packaged)</p><p>Should be brined to contain at least 3.0% water-phase salt in the finished product, with not less than 100 ppm of sodium nitrite (where permitted by §§172.175 and 172.177). If sodium nitrite is not used, the water-phase salt content should be at least 3.5%. b. Brining and dry salting operations should be managed to consistently achieve the recommended water-phase salt or sodium nitrite levels (where permitted by §§172.175 and 172.177) specified in section 5(a). This should be confirmed through a study that establishes these levels are met under specified processing conditions, considering variables such as product size, soak time, and brine ratios. The processor should monitor and record these conditions every 2 hours.</p><p>c. All fish brining should occur in a refrigerated area at 40°F (4.4°C) or lower.</p><p>d. The brine temperature should not exceed 60°F (15.6°C) at the start of each brining process, and this temperature should be recorded.</p>"
