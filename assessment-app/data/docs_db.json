    "document": "FT  04 OCT 94 / Hoverspeed refit to suspend all Channel services By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent Hoverspeed, which operates cross-Channel passenger services, yesterday\nannounced plans for a refit of its entire hovercraft and catamaran fleet,\nleading to the loss of up to 50 out of 410 jobs.\nThe decision to carry out the simultaneous refurbishment of all three of its\ncraft will completely shut down its ferry operations in January and close\nthe Folkestone to Boulogne service for the first three months of the year.\nThe company said this move was timed to coincide with the quietest period in\nthe year for ferry operators.\nHoverspeed normally staggers refurbishments to ensure that at least one\ncraft is in service, but while the entire fleet is out of service the craft\nwill have a full-scale refit, the company said.\nHoverspeed plans a complete Pounds 2m refurbishment of the interiors of its\ntwo 25-year-old hovercraft, the Princess Anne and the Princess Margaret, as\nwell as a refit of their mechanical parts. At the same time it will upgrade\nits high-speed SeaCat catamaran.\nThe SeaCat, which normally plies between Folkestone and Boulogne, will\nresume operations between Dover and Calais in February. The hovercraft will\nreturn to service at the end of March.\nHoverspeed said most of the redundancies would be on the continental side of\nthe Channel and that staff would be re-employed when services resume.\nThe company denied that the refit is related to the start of Channel tunnel\npassenger services, but it runs the only service that can match the tunnel\nfor speed.\nThe tunnel launched a limited car passenger shuttle service yesterday and\nexpects to be operating at close to full capacity by next spring. The\nBritish government might not have 'met its commitments' towards the tunnel,\nthe project's former co-chairman claimed last night.\nHesitations about the building of the high-speed rail link between\nFolkestone and London were 'deeply to be deplored', said Mr Andre Benard,\nco-chairman of Eurotunnel until earlier this year, contrasting the British\nand French approaches.\nSpeaking at a Chartered Institute of Transport lecture in London, Mr Benard\nsaid that although there was no commitment from the British government to\nbuild the link, 'there was a clear commitment that the railways would\nprovide all the required capacity.\n'In that respect, we have very serious doubts that her majesty's government\nhas met its commitments.'\nPrivate-sector consortia are bidding to build and run the Pounds 3bn link\nbut it is unlikely to be in use before the year 2002. The French high-speed\nlink is already in place and the Belgian one will be in service by 1997. Companies:- Hoverspeed (UK). Countries:- GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.\n    FRZ  France, EC.

As a preliminary step a decision \nwas made on joint measures to combat organized crime. There is \nno time to waste -- despite differences in mutual relations \namong the republics, a unified crime-conducive space has \nsurvived in the CIS. Moreover, there is information that \ncriminal formations have \"spread out\" across the whole of the \nformer Union. Almost one-third of permanent criminal groups -- \nand 3,500 of them have been uncovered in Russia -- have \ninterregional links. \n  Commonwealth countries have a common problem in the shape of \n\"illegal\" business in such lucrative fields as the export of \nvarious kinds of raw materials and cultural treasures; \nlarge-scale bank fraud and the theft and resale of cars; and \nextortion, thefts, and attacks on means of transport. A \nparticular danger is posed by gangs engaged in the illegal \ndistribution of drugs and firearms and in foreign currency \ndealings. \n  Criminals have \"staked out\" their own areas in each \nCommunity \nstate. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, for example, are \n\"distinguished\" for weapons sales and foreign currency dealings. \nAll the Transcaucasus republics are famous for their \nconcentration of bandit formations and also for weapons sales. \nAnd raw materials illegally transit the Baltic states. \n  The newly created Bureau is a prototype \"Europol.\" Its work \nwill be much more practical than that of Interpol, which is more \nreminiscent of a police mail box. The Bureau's main task will \nbe precisely to combat crime in the CIS (particularly in its \norganized forms). This is a task which is intended to result in \na decline in social tension, an improvement in the socioeconomic \nsituation, and the regularization of the consumer market. It is \nalso important to ensure that the dangerous processes of the \nmerging of criminal and economic crime do not gather momentum \nand that criminal gang leaders and corrupt officials do not find \na common language. And how is drug addiction and the drugs \nbusiness to be eliminated? All this will undoubtedly fall on \nthe new Bureau's shoulders. \n  The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Arrangements in Civil, \nFamily, and Criminal Cases signed in Minsk 22 January last year \nprovides a good legal basis for the matters which the Bureau \nwill tackle. But first the Convention has to be ratified. This \nis a task for the new [Russian] parliament, which will be faced \nwith a whole series of legislative acts.",

Had I\ninterfered, I think there would have been a very different inquiry going on\nnow,' Mr Lilley said.\nHe said that while serving as trade secretary he had concluded that the\nprosecution would 'certainly fail' after learning that one of the\nbusinessmen being prosecuted had been working for British intelligence.\nHe had also accepted a key aspect of the defence case - that businessmen\ncharged with illegally exporting arms to Iraq had carried out their\nactivities on the basis of advice given to them by Mr Alan Clark, a former\ntrade minister.\nMr Lilley defended his signing of a PII certificate on the basis that there\nwas a 'collective ministerial responsibility' to protect the confidentiality\nof advice given to ministers by officials.\n'You can't unilaterally blow a hole in it (the system of PIIs) and expect to\nremain on board the ship,' he said after being asked by Lord Justice Scott\nwhether he had any discretion not to sign.\nMr Lilley also said he been advised by government lawyers that none of the\ndocuments he was attempting to suppress would have any 'significant\nrelevance' in the Matrix Churchill case.\nHowever, the legal position of ministers signing PII certificates was again\nchallenged by Lord Justice Scott, who made it clear that he considers the\nsubject a central issue of his inquiry.\nWith his counsel, Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, referring to specific documents\ncovered by Mr Lilley's certificate, the judge questioned the necessity of\nthe minister signing a 'class claim' covering suppression of a wide range of\nWhitehall documents, some of which the defence claimed were vital to ensure\na fair trial. Mr Lilley said he had once questioned why, as a minister, he\nhad no more power than that of 'a limited role in classifying documents',\nbut did not receive a 'satisfactory answer'.\nThe minister's evidence last night fuelled the Labour party's growing\noffensive against the government over the Scott inquiry.\nMr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, said it\n'beggared belief' that a cabinet minister knew the Matrix Churchill\nprosecution was a 'mistake' but could do nothing to 'stop a trial that could\nhave put innocent men in prison'.

The \nauthorities must find the answer, and find it quickly. \n  Security agencies have been active in the city, each \nclaiming \nthat they have been more efficient than the other, in effects to \nrestore law and order. But none of these agencies have a clue \nthat who are the elements behind these blasts and what are their \nmotives. \n  In fact, the police were surprisingly ignorant of the \nincidents, \"We are not aware of such incidents. Reports \nappearing in the press are wrong\" claimed a senior police \nofficer. \n  Residents, however, said they heard the blasts in the small \nhours of Saturday. The explosions took place in Gulhan-e-Iqbal \nwhere the Janiat-Uloon-e-Taleemat-e-Islami was the target. A \nhand grenade was hurled at it. \n  In Gulshan-e-Iqhal, Block 4-A where most of the city \njournalists have their houses, the Masjid-e-Taqwa was the \ntarget. A bomb exploded in its courtyard. No injury was caused \nto anyone. The obvious exercise was to create a scare among \nresidents. Syed Fariduddin, 35, District East President of the \nSipah-e-Sababa, a religious organisation, deadly opposed to Shia \ncommunity, was fired at. He received four bullets and was \nhospitalised. Simultaneously, agencies fed the newspaper with \nreports that secretarian clashes in Karachi and the rest of \nSindh were imminent, and that a red alert had been sounded to \nall police and relevant establishments to deal with the \nsituation. \n  In the second incident of violence in which three people \nwere \nkilled some unknown armed young men fired indiscriminately at \ntwo police constables Sultan Meumood and Badruzzaman at Alfalah \nsociety near Wireless gate. Sultan Ahmed was killed on the spot \nwhile his other colleague escaped unhurt. Both constables were \nreturning after performing their guard duty at National Bank \nBranch in Alfalah. \n  In another incident, three unidentified dacoits killed a \nchowkider for Bonglow No. S-29, phase II in Defence area. The \ndacoits gunned down chowkidar after be foiled their dacoity \nattempt by resisting their entry into the house. \n  In yet another incident, unknown snipers killed Mukammad Ali \nin Landhi area this afternoon.

    "document": "FLORIDA RESTAURANT LOAN SCHEME GOES SOUR By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER MIAMI Law enforcement authorities say pension-fund officials who have little loyalty \nto their members are especially vulnerable to the sort of approach that Florida \nbusinessman Leonard J. Mercer Jr. used on his friend, Joseph J. Higgins. Mercer, a Ft. Lauderdale hotel owner, told Higgins that he needed $375,000 to \npurchase the Ta-Boo, a Palm Beach restaurant. Higgins had access to that much money and more. He had been retained by New \nJersey Teamsters Local 701 to invest $20 million worth of union pension funds \nin residential and commercial loans. But Higgins told Mercer that union rules, which were designed to protect \nmembers, restricted how Higgins' company, Omni Funding Group Inc., could invest \nthe Teamsters' pension funds. In particular, no funds could be placed in \nhigh-risk ventures such as bars, restaurants and bowling alleys. According to federal court records, Mercer then devised a scheme for Omni \nFunding to advance him the money under the guise that it would be used to \nrefinance his hotel. Omni provided the loan and submitted false reports about it to the Teamsters \nlocal, which forwarded them to the U.S. Labor Department. In return, Mercer \npaid $42,500 in kickbacks to Higgins in the form of cash, free hotel suites, \nmeals and other gifts. Reporting false information about pension-fund loans is a violation of the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act, which Congress passed in 1974 to \ntighten up supervision over pension funds. Acting on an insider's tip, the Labor Department's Office of Labor \nRacketeering, in conjunction with the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, launched \na criminal investigation into Mercer and Higgins that led to guilty pleas by \nboth men and their eventual imprisonment. Mercer pleaded guilty to kickback charges as well as perjury for lying to a \nfederal grand jury when he testified that Higgins had paid for his stays at \nGalt Ocean Mile Hotel, which Mercer owned. Identified by the Pennsylvania Crime \nCommission as a longtime associate of Philadelphia mob figures, Mercer received \nfour years in prison and a $40,000 fine. In a separate court appearance, Higgins pleaded guilty to perjury, wire fraud \nand mail fraud and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Two trustees and two lawyers for the Teamsters' New Jersey pension fund also \nwere eventually implicated in similar corrupt dealings with Higgins. One of \nthose implicated pleaded guilty and the other three were convicted of \nracketeering and mail fraud. And nothing worked out for Mercer. Before he went off to jail last spring, his \nhotel and restaurant went bankrupt.

Such a union would amount to a Serb-Croat carve-up of Bosnia,\nleaving the Moslems without a homeland.\nThey also indicated that they would renege on their promise to surrender\nland if Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic failed to endorse an agreement\non the republic's partition.\nMr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, accused his Moslem foes of wanting\n'more war' by posing new demands. In closed-door meetings, the Serbian\ndelegation raised the stakes by threatening to proclaim as permanent the\ncurrent borders of their self-styled state, which, after 22 months of war,\ncomprises 70 per cent of Bosnia.\nIn a scathing indictment, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister,\ndescribed the partition talks as 'futile', accusing the international\ncommunity of 'supporting fascist aggression' on Bosnia at the expense of a\n'multicultural, multi-ethnic state'\nThe toughened stance, suggesting that they do not take seriously the threats\nof Nato air strikes against Serbian targets, was agreed at a session of the\nSerbian 'parliament' on Monday in Bosnia.\nUN officials said yesterday that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN\nsecretary-general, had asked Mr Yasushi Akashi, his special envoy in former\nYugoslavia, to draft concrete plans to open up the airport in Tuzla, the\nbiggest Bosnian stronghold, in an effort to renew pressure on the Bosnian\nSerbs.\nMr Akashi also said yesterday he had not ruled out the use of air power, as\nthreatened last week at the Nato summit. But a diplomat admitted air strikes\nwere not 'high on the agenda at this time'. Countries:- GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.\n    BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.

Fitzpatrick &amp; Co,\nsaid he was confident that it could be proved his client's disease was\nattributable to smoking.\nMr John Dean, 37, of Ballywalter, Co Down, suffers from Beurger's disease,\nwhich causes constriction of the arteries and in its most severe form can\nlead to gangrene and loss of limbs. The disease is incurable but can be\ncontrolled.\nAlthough the disease has not advanced to the serious stage in Mr Dean's\ncase, he claims that he has been unable to work for seven years and his\nfamily life has been adversely affected. Mr Dean began smoking in his early\nteens.\nMr Fitzpatrick said the uniqueness of his case lay in the fact that\nBeurger's disease is thought to be caused directly by smoking. With other\nsmoking-related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer it is very\nhard to prove that nothing else could have caused the disease.\nMr Fitzpatrick said Mr Dean had a strong case because he had only ever\nsmoked one brand of cigarette, Benson &amp; Hedges, made by Gallaher.\nThe case will revolve around the extent of the tobacco industry's knowledge\nof the harmful side effects of its products, when it took action to warn\npeople of those side effects and whether the warnings it gave were\nsufficient.\nHe said: 'Just because a company complies with the statutory obligation to\nwarn about the dangers of smoking does not necessarily mean it has complied\nwith the wider common-law duty of care owed to consumers.'\nThe court will have to look at what warnings were available to Mr Dean\nduring the period when he was smoking and what advertising and promotion was\nbeing pursued by the tobacco companies at the time. His lawyers will argue\nthat there has been an attempt by the tobacco industry to disarm the\nstatutory warning through advertising suggesting that the warnings are\nincluded on packets and in advertisements only because the government\ninsists on them.\nMr Mark Mildred, a personal-injury and product liability lawyer with London\nsolicitors Pannone Napier, said\nthat to succeed in a damages action against a cigarette manufacturer under\nEnglish law, a plaintiff had to prove negligence by the manufacturer in\npromotion of the product; that the negligence resulted in damage; that the\ninjuries were caused exclusively by tobacco; and that the manufacturer of\nthe product which caused the injury could be clearly identified.\nGallaher said yesterday it could not comment on the case but it would be\ndefending it vigorously.\nThe company is expected to argue that Mr Dean was addicted to smoking by the\ntime there was a duty to warn him of the danger of Beurger's disease.

A joint \ncommunique has been issued that mainly discusses the regional \nconflicts in the former Soviet Union, disarmament, and \nBosnia-Herzegovina. \n  Sources close to the conference have said that no \nconcessions \nwere made to Russia's objections concerning the Azeri-Armenian \nconflict and the reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe \n[CFE]. \n  The statement supports the idea of holding a conference \nwithin the framework of the CSCE to reach a lasting and just \nsolution to the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict. The statement \nsays that the problem can be resolved only through negotiations. \n  The statement points out that the NACC follows developments \nin the Crimean Autonomous Republic with concern. It adds that \nthe problem should be resolved within the framework of the \nterritorial integrity of the Ukraine. \n  The statement discusses the Russian military presence in the \nBaltic countries without using the word Russia. It says that \nthe withdrawal of foreign troops from these areas as soon as \npossible will contribute positively to the security of both the \nregional countries and Europe. \n  On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says that a political \nsolution should be reached as soon as possible. \n  On arms control and disarmament, the statement stresses the \nimportance of fully implementing all the existing agreements on \nthe issue. The statement stresses the need to fully implement \nwithin this framework the CFE, the agreement to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear arms, and the agreements on chemical \nand biological weapons, as well as poisonous gases. \n  The statement says that an agreement must be concluded as \nsoon as possible that completely bans nuclear experiments. \n  NATO Acting Secretary General Sergio Balanzino held a news \nconference at the end of the meeting where he said that Russia \naccepted the Partnership for Peace plan as it is, but that it \nrequested a [word indistinct] on how the plan will work. \n  Balanzino stressed that it was very important for all the \nmembers to reach an agreement. If that had not been achieved, \nhe said, we would have given a negative message to the world. \n  Replying to questions, Balanzino said that Russia is a very \nimportant force in Europe and NATO's close relations with this \nforce will contribute to world peace. \n  Asked if Kozyrev's objections to the joint statement are a \nnegative sign that Russia might change its policies in the \nfuture, Balanzino said: I do not know the answer to that \nquestion. I do not know about the future. However, today, \nthere is no change of policy. Maybe Kozyrev lacked sleep, maybe \nhe was tired.",

The\ncompany was forced to offer Pounds 56m discounts in the US.\nAmong the newer products, Augmentin increased sales by 24 per cent to Pounds\n504m and Seroxat, an anti-depressant, gained 10.7 per cent of the UK market\nby value.\nClinical laboratories operations increased sales 13 per cent to Pounds 539m\nand profits 24 per cent to Pounds 68m.\nThe animal health business achieved a 4 per cent increase in sales to Pounds\n318m and a 9 per cent rise in trading profits to Pounds 63m.\nSales in the US consumer division fell 9 per cent as customers ran down\ntheir stocks.\nMr Hugh Collum, finance director, announced the company wanted to split its\nA and B shares on a 2-for-1 basis to increase liquidity and help smaller\nshareholders.\nThe equity unit is also to be divided to comprise one split B share and a\nreduced preferred share to make the A shares and the equity unit more easily\ncomparable.\nThe changes will be put to shareholders at the annual meeting in May.\nEarnings per share increased 17 per cent from 41p to 48p and earnings per\nequity unit from 205p to 240p.

Their self-congratulations were justified, but the more difficult\ntask of generating organic growth remains before them. The most pressing\nquestion is whether the new generation of drugs will be able to compensate\nfor those reaching or having reached the end of their patents. An increase\nin pharmaceuticals sales of only 4 per cent is decidedly sedentary compared\nwith other companies and the outlook in Japan looks more than tricky with\nfurther hefty price-cuts in the pipeline. On the upside, the stock is likely\nto be less vulnerable to a move out of pharmaceutical companies into\ncyclicals because of its consumer products division.

This\nconsortium includes Transurb Consultants of Belgium and WS Atkins, the UK\nconsulting engineers.\nLondon Electricity, the chairman of which is Sir Bob Reid who also chairs\nBritish Rail, yesterday announced it had withdrawn from the EuroRail\nconsortium because of a possible conflict of interest.

In an elaborate pre-dawn send-off, members of the environmental activist group \nscaled the side of the tanker, rechristened the Exxon Mediterranean, and \nunfurled a banner that read \"Sane Energy: When?\" Two demonstrators, handcuffed \nto each other, perched atop the huge rudder, while six more attempted to block \nthe ship's passage by forming a human oil boom in the chilly water. San Diego Harbor Police officers quickly quashed the demonstration, arresting \nnine of an estimated 40 protesters, according to Chief Arthur Le Blanc. But by \nthe time divers could confirm that demonstrators had not damaged the newly \nrepaired hull of the tanker that caused the nation's worst oil spill, Exxon \nfaced another problem: fog. \"It was thick. Two hundred feet from the pier, (the ship) disappeared,\" said \nFred Hallett, the vice president of National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., \nwhere the ship was built and received $30 million in repairs. \"Somebody said, \n'She's gone.' And then the captain held her out in the channel for more than an \nhour.\" At noon, after the fog lifted, the 987-foot Exxon Mediterranean finally set \nsail for Singapore -- its first stop before heading to the Middle East. In July, Exxon officials announced that because of a declining need to \ntransport Alaskan crude oil, the embattled tanker would become the first \nU.S.-licensed tanker to enter foreign service. It will load Middle Eastern oil \nin the Mediterranean and deliver it to Europe, officials said. Critics charged that the reassignment was a public relations move designed to \ndistance the ship from Alaska's Prince William Sound, where it ran aground on \nMarch 24, 1989, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil and tearing up \none-third of its hull. But Exxon officials said good business sense, not image-building, predicated \nthe change. On Wednesday, Les Rogers, a spokesman for Exxon Shipping Co., \nseemed unfazed by the protests and delays, saying he was just pleased that the \nvessel was on its way. \"We're ready for the voyage,\" he said, noting that the Mediterranean had \ndemonstrated its seaworthiness in 10 days of ocean trials that ended last week.

    "document": "HARTWIG SHIPMATE DEFENDS HIM AS NO 'SUICIDAL FREAK' From Associated Press WASHINGTON Gunner's Mate Kendall L. Truitt told Congress on Wednesday that former crew \nmate Clayton M. Hartwig was no \"suicidal freak\" and did not cause the explosion \nthat killed Hartwig and 46 other sailors on the battleship Iowa. Truitt accused the Navy of using \"a big cover-up\" to thwart theories that the \nshipboard explosion was accidental rather than caused intentionally, \"most \nlikely\" by Hartwig, as the Navy has concluded. Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Armed Services \nsubcommittee on investigations, also has been critical of the Navy's report. \nAnd at the end of the hearing he told Vice Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III, \"You've \npointed your finger when there's that little chance\" that the explosion was \naccidental. \"Wouldn't you have been better off to say we don't know?\" the congressman \nasked. Donnell said the Navy believes \"we do know\" that Hartwig most likely caused the \nexplosion. Truitt said Hartwig was not told until the morning of April 19 that he was \ngoing to be positioned at center gun in the No. 2 gun turret, \"so there would \nhave been no time for planning\" a suicide explosion. He said Hartwig had once \ntalked of suicide, but Truitt said he did not take him seriously. Truitt said his own theory is that the blast was caused by a defective \nhydraulic rammer -- the piece of equipment used to shove the powder bags up \nagainst the projectile in the huge gun. He said he had had a problem with a rammer on the left gun in the No. 2 gun \nturret about a year earlier, describing it as behaving like a transmission \nstuck between neutral and drive. He theorized that the rammer might have \n\"suddenly taken off,\" putting too much pressure on the propellant. He also maintained that gunpowder on the Iowa had been stored in high heat, \nthat the cans were not airtight, and that \"you could smell ether\" when entering \na powder storage area. Truitt said the fact that the crew mates working closest \nto the center gun had not gone through the exercise together before \"may have \nbeen a contributing factor\" in the blast. Questioned about his personal relationship with Hartwig, Truitt said they had a \nbasically strong friendship, with occasional quarrels. Under questioning, he \ndenied that they had ever been homosexual lovers. The Navy's official report on the Iowa accident made no mention of a possible \nhomosexual link between the two, although there had been earlier news reports \nthat Naval Investigative Service agents were pursuing such a theory.

The draft Council Resolution on the \nsubject submitted to the Council of Ministers' Research/Atomic \nQuestions Group during the Belgian Presidency has been struck \noff the agenda of the March 4 Research Council after the United \nKingdom, Germany and Ireland insisted this was a problem for the \nindividual reactor operators to handle, not the EU. The draft \nResolution would need unanimous Council support to be adopted. \n  The proposed text arguably seeks to kill at least two birds \nwith one stone. Belgium has never been happy about the \nperceived unfair competition from the EU-funded Joint Research \nCentre experimental reactor in Petten, the Netherlands, whose \ncosts -- decommissioning for example -- are calculated on a \nsomewhat different basis from those of Mol. \n  The proposal argues that the viability of test reactors (and \nEU research reactors in general) depends on finding a long-term \nsolution for the problem of initial fuel supply and final waste \ndisposal. Some observers suggest that turning fuel supply into \na Union responsibility could be seen as an attempt by Belgium to \nencourage the EU to allow Russia to sell its cheap nuclear fuel \non the EU market. Belgium, with its large nuclear industry but \nno domestic nuclear fuel production, would be the obvious \nbeneficiary. \n  The Commission is currently negotiating a new Euratom \nAgreement on behalf of the EU with the United States on nuclear \nmaterials trade and services amid an international tussle over \nwhether the United States should take back the spent enriched \nuranium it has been supplying to research reactors in Belgium, \nAustria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and \nSwitzerland. \n  The main problem area of the Euratom Agreement negotiations \nconcerns the U.S. demand that it should be able to monitor the \nmovements of nuclear material of U.S. origin within the EU -- a \nproposals which the EU adamantly refuses to countenance. The \nproposed text for the Resolution nevertheless includes a clause \nstating that the Commission should highlight the importance of \nfinding a solution for disposing of radioactive waste from \nEuropean experimental reactors in its negotiations with \nWashington. \n  EU Energy Commissioner Abel Matutes is expected to take up \nthe issue of consent rights with U.S. Secretary of State Warren \nChristopher at a meeting in March.",

He stated \nthat no authority, whether domestic or foreign, is entitled to \ninterfere with the JCE's announcement of election results, as \nthe U.S. State Department did this past Wednesday. \n  Balaguer's statements drew an immediate response from the \nU.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, which reiterated the U.S. \ncommitment to democracy in America. \n  Despite his criticism of the request, Balaguer agreed to \nstage complementary elections in those communities in which \nvoters were excluded from voting lists. The United States \npraised Balaguer's decision to repeat the elections, leaving the \nfinal decision to the JCE, adding that \"such a decision will \npave the way toward resolving the controversial results.\" \n  Balaguer explained he supports some of the recommendations \nmade by the United States, but he added that he opposes any \ndomestic or foreign interference in the JCE's decisions. He \nalso reiterated that the JCE is the organization that will \ndecide which measures will be adopted to resolve the issue. \n  On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Michael McCurry \nreleased a document sent to the Dominican Government which \ncalled for an investigation and clarification into charges of \nirregularities reported by international observers. The \ndocument notes: \"The United States strongly urges the release of \nthe actual documents that were used at the voting tables on \nElection Day.\" \n  The balloting is being protested by the Dominican \nRevolutionary Party (PRD), which contends that at least 200,000 \nvoters were excluded, mainly supporters of this party's \npresidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez. \n  Balaguer stated that the past elections were the cleanest \nand \nmost transparent ever staged in the Dominican Republic, as well \nas in Latin America. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that \nfollowing the elections, the Dominican economy has been \nparalyzed by the JCE's delay in announcing the winner, although \nhe pointed out that the economy will recover once the election \nprocess has concluded. \n  Balaguer also blamed the opposition for the electoral \ntribunal's delay in announcing the winner because the number of \nchallenges that have been filed, particularly by the PRD, are \npreventing the JCE from proclaiming a winner without first \nconcluding investigations into the charges.",

    "document": "FT  10 MAY 94 / Mandela ends journey from prison to power By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PATTI WALDMEIR CAPE TOWN Mr Nelson Mandela yesterday completed his journey from prison to the\npresidency when South Africa's newly elected parliament chose him as the\ncountry's first black head of state.\nThe characteristic sounds and symbols of Africa echoed through the\nlegislative chamber. Women ululated with joy from the African National\nCongress benches and a traditional Thembu praise singer, clad in skins and\nbeads, chanted the new president's honour. Erstwhile rivals embraced and\napartheid's former defenders saluted their new chief. Men and women\nconvicted of treason swore an oath of loyalty to the new state.\nMr Mandela stood hand on heart as a military band played 'Die Stem' (The\nVoice), anthem of apartheid South Africa. A white policeman saluted as the\nsame band played the liberation hymn, 'Nkosi sikele i'Afrika' (God bless\nAfrica). Both are now official anthems.\nMr Ronnie Kasrils, newly elected ANC member of parliament once known as the\nscarlet pimpernel for his efforts to elude the law, spoke for many when he\nsaid of the spectacle: 'I have to keep pinching myself.'\nShares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange rose 2.5 per cent as political\neuphoria dominated market sentiment.\nFor the day at least, old enmities were set aside. Mr Mandela appeared\ndelighted to spot Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi in the chamber,\nand crossed the floor to embrace him. He also went out of his way to greet\nGeneral Constand Viljoen, leader of the rightwing Freedom Front, and Pan\nAfricanist Congress leader Mr Clarence Makwethu.\nThe government of national unity neared completion with the announcement of\nsix ministers from the outgoing National party government. Mr Pik Botha,\nformer foreign minister, becomes minister of mineral and energy affairs, Mr\nRoelf Meyer, chief constitutional negotiator, was named minister of\nprovincial affairs and constitutional development, and Dawie de Villiers,\nCape NP leader, was appointed minister of environment.\nMr Mandela made his first public address as president from the spot where in\nFebruary 1990 he spoke after his release from 27 years in jail. He told\nthousands outside Cape Town city hall: 'Today we are entering a new era.\nToday we celebrate not the victory of a party but a victory for all the\npeople of South Africa.\n'We place our vision of a new constitutional order on the table not as\nconquerors, prescribing to the conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to\nheal the wounds of the past with the intent of constructing a new order\nbased on justice for all.\"\nMr Mandela pledged a social order 'which respects completely the culture,\nlanguage and religious rights of all sections of our society and the\nfundamental rights of the individual'.\nThey're all in this together, Page 17 Countries:- ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

    "document": "SUIT ACCUSES ESCONDIDO POLICE OF PLANTING DRUGS By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER An Escondido architect convicted of a drug charge and his wife have sued \nEscondido police, alleging that they planted drugs on him and conducted an \nillegal search of their home. John and Pamela Aldridge, whose allegations of police wrongdoing sparked \ninvestigations by the FBI and the district attorney, filed separate but \nidentical lawsuits Wednesday. The amount of damages was not specified. Assistant Chief Mike Stein said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment on the \nlawsuits. Stein is not named as a defendant, but Chief Vincent Jimno and \nseveral Escondido officers are. The Aldridges are seeking money for emotional distress and other damages \nallegedly suffered during a police search of their home and business June 28, \n1989. Nine months after the searches, Vista Municipal Court Judge Victor E. Ramirez \noverturned the search warrant for the residence. The lawsuits quote Ramirez \naccusing Detective Barry Sweeney, who signed the search warrant affidavit, of \nlying in his declaration. \"This affidavit, the import of it, the statements contained within it, the \nscope of the warrant that was issued as a result of it are absolutely prepared \nwith reckless disregard for the truth,\" Ramirez said. \"I can't say it to you in \nstronger words than I have said here, that it's just totally shocking to me.\" In a May interview with The Times, Sweeney dismissed Ramirez's lecture as \"a \nfavor\" that the judge was doing for attorney Jose Tafolla, who was representing \nJohn Aldridge. He denied doing anything wrong in preparing the affidavit. Ramirez ruled that a police search of his office was legal, and that John \nAldridge was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of possessing methamphetamine. \nHe was sentenced to 90 days in County Jail, but is free while appealing the \nconviction. The lawsuits by the Aldridges alleged that Detective David Sparks planted \nmethamphetamine in John Aldridge's jeans following an unsuccessful search of \nhis office for drugs. The lawsuit alleges that Aldridge had already been \nsearched by two other officers, who did not find any drugs. Aldridge was arrested about three months after the couple accused Sparks' \nsister, Sherry Sparks Crane, of stealing the couple's Master Card, according to \nthe lawsuit. About $2,500 in illegal charges were rung up on the card, the \nAldridges said. About 16 months after the theft, Escondido police said they have made no \narrests. On Thursday, Stein said that Crane is not a suspect in the case. Crane \ncould not be reached for comment. The Aldridges said they and the bank that issued the card have been asked by \npolice on five occasions to provide them with the same packet of photocopied \nreceipts. Stein said he had \"no idea\" why police have requested so many copies \nof the same receipts. The lawsuits allege that Crane's boyfriend called Pamela Aldridge on April 27, \n1989, and said that Crane's brother \"would get even\" with the couple.",

    "document": "HAPPY HOLIDAY FROM BAGHDAD; IRAQ CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT ALL IS WELL WITH ALL THE HOSTAGES Iraqi officials profess indignation over reports that the hostages they seized \nafter invading Kuwait are being mistreated. Information Minister Latif Jassim \nnotes, \"We are Arabs, Arab Muslims . . . Our guests are very important to us,\" \nas if merely invoking a tradition of hospitality is proof that it is being \nhonored. Recently freed French hostages, now safely back home, tell a far \ngrimmer story. They report that Western detainees, especially American and \nBritish, are in many cases being subjected to consistent and sadistic physical \nand psychological abuse. Some are said to be near the breaking point. An official in Baghdad says his country is prepared to allow the families of \nthe hostages to visit them over the Christmas and New Year's holiday. For those \nsuddenly cut off by Iraq's aggression from contact with loved ones, the \nputative offer holds out the hope of joyful reunions. Others, less emotionally \ninvolved, will look on it as yet another cynical ploy to try to manipulate \npublic opinion in the West and portray Saddam Hussein's murderous regime as \nbenign, humane, caring -- the exact opposites of what its record in fact shows \nit to be. Note first of all that the Iraqi spokesman who raised the prospect of family \nvisits insisted on anonymity. There are thus no fingerprints on this supposed \ninvitation, nothing whatever to tie it to government policy. As things stand \nnow, it is a retractable, ignorable, deniable proposal. Note, too, that the holidays are still nearly two months away. That's a long \ntime for the hostages, for their families, for the development of events. \nNaturally, the separated family members who now think they may be able to see \ntheir loved ones can be expected to exert all the pressures they can to \nforestall any actions that might jeopardize their chances of going to Baghdad. The condition of the hostages, to say nothing of their fate, is assuming ever \ngreater importance, political as well as emotional. President Bush -- whether \nhe was speaking offhandedly or calculatedly -- warns that his patience is near \nan end. Iraqi officials respond that Bush is looking for a pretext to take \nmilitary action. A pretext is a false reason for doing something. But there's \nnothing artificial about Bush's reminder that one of his responsibilities is to \nprotect the lives of Americans abroad. Iraq continues to insist that all is well with all the hostages. Prove it. The \nRed Cross stands ready to inquire into their safety, to determine whether they \nare being fed, sheltered and medicated. There is evidence that some are not, \nthat they are instead forced to live in squalid, even life-threatening \ncircumstances. Iraq denies this, although Wednesday it said it would be \nreleasing four sick and elderly Americans. But the only sure way to really \nlearn the facts is to permit objective international observers to see for \nthemselves. Editorial",

The major leitmotif of the talks was the \nimplementation of the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement signed in \nMoscow in January 1994, as well as the agreements reached during \nthe recent U.S.-Ukrainian summit meeting in Washington. They \ncall for Ukraine's \"denucliarisation\" and providing it with \ncompensations and security guarantees. \n  The second most important issue is cooperation between \nUkraine and the United States within the programmes of economic \ncooperation and defence conversion. The U.S. will provide \nfinancial assistance to Ukraine to finance the conversion of its \ndefence industry and build housing for the demobilised military. \n  Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine is unswervingly observing its \nobligations under the three-party agreement -- it has sent the \nsecond train full of nuclear warheads to Russia. \n  Perry stressed that relations between Ukraine and the United \nStates are strategically important. He and Ukrainian Defence \nMinister Vitaliy Radetskyy who also attended the talks signed an \nagreement under which Ukraine will be granted 50 million dollars \nin addition to 135 million it is to receive under the Strategic \nArms Reduction Treaty. The means will be used to finance the \ndismantlement of SS-24 missiles. \n  Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement as a \n\"historic move and a way-out of the nuclear deadlock.\" \"This \nstep and the ratification by Ukraine of the START-1 Treaty and \nthe Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free state virtually removes \nall juridical and other barriers for Ukraine's joining the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" he said. \n  At the same time, Radetskyy said that \"the fulfillment of \nobligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process.\" \nHe stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out \ndisarmament and solving social problems facing the military. \n  \"We have also reached full understanding on issues \nconcerning \nthe Partnership for Peace Programme. We understand that \nUkraine's future aims at full accession to European structures,\" \nRadetskyy said. \n  The sides also discussed cooperation in space exploration. \nThe talks were attended by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William \nMiller.",

But the conservative Li faced new opposition within the policy-making Politburo \nStanding Committee. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said a Politburo meeting will be called Thursday \nor Friday. Also today, China informed Western television stations that it was cutting off \nsatellite transmissions as of midnight (8 a.m. PDT), ending their ability to \nbroadcast from China. Li declared martial law in Beijing on Saturday, ordering troops to restore \norder in the city, where more than 1 million people have rallied in support of \na student campaign for a freer China and an end to official corruption. The student protests have galvanized the nation, inspiring the largest \nspontaneous movement in Communist China's 40 years. Sit-In's 12th Day Soldiers were deployed on Beijing's outskirts today but did not move on tens of \nthousands of student protesters, now on their 12th day of a sit-in at central \nTian An Men Square. Over the weekend, throngs of city residents erected street barricades to \nprevent an army advance, stalling convoys. Hundreds of thousands of protesters \nalso took to the streets in dozens of other cities. All reportedly called for \nLi's ouster. Subway and bus service resumed in Beijing, and traffic appeared near normal \ntoday. Although the army's inability to enforce martial law has called into doubt its \nwillingness to follow Li's orders, the official New China News Agency said six \nof seven military regions support the decision to call troops to Beijing. Only \nthe Beijing military command was not mentioned. Liberation Army Daily, the military newspaper, today published a letter from \narmy headquarters urging soldiers sent to enforce martial law to \"fully \nunderstand the nature of this struggle.\" 'Hard Struggle' The letter said, \"The turmoil created by an extremely small number of people \nstill has not been quelled. If their scheme succeeds, then the 10 years of hard \nstruggle for reform and the work of establishing of modernizing socialism will \nbe destroyed in a moment.\" On Monday, however, more than 100 senior army officers signed a letter seeking \nan end to martial law, suggesting a deep split in the military. Two government sources said today that Hu Qili, one of five members in the \npolicy-making Politburo Standing Committee, had thrown his support to the \nrelatively liberal Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who is battling Li. Hu is in charge of the state-run press. On Tuesday, some official reports \ncriticized Li's attempts to carry out martial law. Reports have circulated that Zhao -- who had urged conciliation with the \nstudents -- had offered to resign rather than order troops into Beijing. Wire",

Last Thursday the Islamic Republic of Iran News \nAgency (IRNA) reported, without quoting the source, that Mr. \nRobert Pelletreau, undersecretary of state for Near Eastern \naffairs had said that Washington did not intend to subvert the \nIslamic government in Iran and that it was ready to sit down \nwith Iranian officials and discuss outstanding issues on which \nTehran and Washington have different views. Mr. Pelletreau was \nalso quoted as saying that the political system in Iran is here \nto stay for a long time to come. \n  It has been noticed that the subject of Iran-America \nrelations is usually raised when some tragic event occurs in the \nMuslim world. For instance, the topic was widely discussed in \nthe western media simultaneously with the signing of an accord \nin Washington last September between Mr. Yasir 'Arafat and Mr. \nYitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the Zionist state. \n  And now we hear the same story told by a different person \nafter the slaughter of more than 60 Palestinian worshipers at \nthe al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Al-Khalil (Hebron). \n  This might have been done with the intention of diverting \nattention of the people of Iran from vital issues and maybe for \nconveying a message to its officials that if they should look \nthe other way, they would be compensated. \n  Nevertheless, the official stance of the Islamic Republic of \nIran on this issue has been made known on many occasions. The \nlast time it was done was by the leader of the Islamic \nRevolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, who said on the 14th \nanniversary of the seizure of the former U.S. Embassy by Muslim \nstudents in Tehran that, \"The Iranian nation does not need to \nnegotiate, or have relations with an arrogant enemy such as \nAmerica.\" \n  Anyway, if Washington is sincere in its aims to reconcile \ndifferences with a big Muslim country in the Middle East the \neasiest way would be to settle all financial matters with Iran. \nThe first step Clinton's administration can take is release all \nIranian assets that were frozen by the former U.S. president \nJimmy Carter. The next step would be to attend to other issues \nof dispute between America and Iran such as the downing of the \npassenger airliner in the Persian Gulf. These and several other \npoints can be negotiated and a solution found to end the \nanimosity between Iran and America. But will the U.S. ever be \nable to keep aside its arrogance? Will it realize that a \nrevolutionary nation can never be forced to yield by arrogance, \nthreats and baseless accusations such as international terrorism \nand violation of human rights?",

    "document": "INDICTMENT IN SEARS FRAUD CASE REINSTATED By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer A federal appeals court on Thursday once again reinstated a criminal indictment \nagainst Sears, Roebuck in a U.S. Customs Service fraud case that has been the \nfocus of a long-running battle between the appellate court and the chief \nfederal judge in Los Angeles. Sears -- which has been facing the on-again, off-again charges for nearly nine \nyears -- was under indictment again this week after the U.S. 9th Circuit Court \nof Appeals revived the case for the fourth time, rejecting arguments that the \ncompany's right to a speedy trial had been violated in the lengthy \njurisprudential debate. Judge Manuel Real, the chief federal jurist in Los Angeles, had three times \ndismissed the indictment, siding with Sears' argument that the original \nprosecutor had badgered witnesses during grand jury proceedings before the \nindictment was returned against the retailer in 1980. After the third dismissal, the appeals court ordered Real to re-assign the case \nto another judge, saying his highly critical statements about the government \nprosecutor and his repeated dismissals were evidence of \"an appearance of his \nunwillingness to preside in this case.\" Real, calling the reassignment order an assault on the independence of trial \njudges, appealed the order to the U.S. Supreme Court and gave up the case to \nJudge A. Andrew Hauk only after the high court refused to take the case. Hauk responded by dismissing the indictment yet again during the first hearing \nhe set and by imposing monetary sanctions on the prosecution, which he later \nreversed. \"This is the fourth time around now. How many warnings do you want?\" Hauk asked \nJustice Department lawyers. Fourth Appeal Filed The government appealed for a fourth time, and with Thursday's order, prevailed \nyet again.

In a later submission to the Plant committee he estimated\nthat the 1992 results would have left the Tories as the largest party but\nwith Labour able to form a government with the support of Liberal Democrats\nand nationalists.\nThe number of Liberal Democrat MPs would have been between 44 and 48 -\ncompared with 20 at present.\nSuch calculations have to be treated with caution.\nUnder proportional representation, the behaviour of voters, as well as the\ncampaign tactics of the political parties, would undoubtedly change.\nIf a supplementary vote system was adopted, voters would indicate a first\nand second preference.\nIf no candidate secured 50 per cent or more, the first and second placed\ncandidates then enter a run off with the votes for the eliminated candidates\ndistributed according to second preferences. Whoever then has the highest\ntally wins.\nAt the last general election, about half of the current number of sitting\nMPs won a straight majority of their constituencies' electors.\nThis is how the system could have affected some of those who did not:\nLOSER?

OFFICERS, TARGET OF STING, STOLE MONEY, POLICE ALLEGE By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER Two Los Angeles Police Department officers, targets of an undercover sting \noperation, were caught last week taking a small amount of cash from a police \nofficer posing as a narcotics dealer, department sources said Monday. The patrol officers, who were suspected of stealing from people they have \narrested, have been reassigned pending the results of an ongoing investigation \nby the Internal Affairs Division, according to police sources. The two officers, working on loan to the narcotics division of the Police \nDepartment's West Los Angeles Bureau, were members of a \"chase team\" called in \nto arrest a suspected drug dealer on Friday, sources said. But after arresting \nthe \"dealer\" -- actually an undercover police officer -- the pair allegedly \npocketed some of the money they had confiscated. Sources said the amount of money taken was less than $100, but Cmdr. William \nBooth, who refused to name the officers or even talk about the details of the \ncase, said any theft by a police officer is considered a serious breach. \"If the investigation establishes a prima facie case of a crime being committed \n. . . then we will present it to the district attorney to consider filing \ncriminal charges,\" he said. The disclosure of the Police Department sting comes at a time when 18 suspended \nLos Angeles County sheriff's officers face a federal grand jury probe into \nallegations that they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from narcotics \nsuspects during drug busts. As part of that investigation, federal investigators had searched the home of \none LAPD narcotics officer, but no action has been taken against that officer \nby either the Police Department or by federal authorities. Police officials stress that this latest investigation is unrelated to the \nsheriff's scandal. \"This was an opportunistic thing, a small-time deal,\" said \none official. Booth told The Times that the investigation was actually launched after the \ndepartment received a complaint several weeks ago from a man who contended that \nhe was missing some property after his arrest. \"That property was located under \ncircumstances that cast suspicion on a couple of officers,\" Booth said. In last Friday's sting, narcotics detectives pretended to arrange a drug buy \nwith an undercover police officer posing as a narcotics dealer, sources said. \nThen, the narcotics team radioed the two patrol officers to chase down the \n\"suspect\" and arrest him. After making the arrest, the two officers allegedly \ntook the money from the man, sources said. \"It was not a significant amount,\" said one narcotics officer familiar with the \ncase. \"It was like taking the pocket contents of a street dealer . . . but \nthese guys went for the sting.\" STING OPERATIONS; LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT; POLICE -- LOS ANGELES; POLICE \nMISCONDUCT; EMPLOYEE THEFTS; POLICE INVESTIGATIONS; ROBBERIES -- LOS ANGELES; \nDRUG TRAFFICKING -- LOS ANGELES",

Since the 1990 collapse of Cuba's\ntrade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc, the Cuban government had\nbeen seeking a foreign partner to help run the refinery at the south-central\nport of Cienfuegos.\nThe installation, completed at the end of the last decade, was practically\nunused and is currently idle.\nAnnouncing the deal in Havana yesterday, Mexico's secretary for foreign\nrelations (foreign minister), Mr Manuel Tello, said the Mexpetrol group\nwould have a 49 per cent stake in the refining joint venture. The group is\nformed by state institutions Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Banco Nacional de\nComercio Exterior (Bancomex), and Mexico's Instituto de Petroleo, and by\nfour private companies, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, Bufete Industrial,\nProtexa and Empresa de Transportaciones Maritimas Mexicanas. Cuba's state\noil company, Cubapetroleo, will control 51 per cent of the venture.\nMr Tello said the latest investment by Mexican entrepreneurs in Cuba\ncompleted the liquidation of Cuba's remaining Dollars 340m debt with Mexico.\nCuba, seeking foreign capital to revitalise its recession-hit economy, has\nalready opened up offshore and onshore exploration blocks to oil companies\nfrom Canada, France and Britain.\nOnce operating fully again, the Cienfuegos refinery, which has a capacity of\n75,000 barrels a day, will refine crude oil from both Mexico and other\ncountries. The resulting oil products could be sold in Cuba, Mexico or to\nthird-party buyers on a commercial basis, Mr Tello said. Besides earning\nhard currency, the refining deal is also expected to help Cuba alleviate the\nchronic shortages of oil and oil products since oil supplies from the former\nSoviet Union fell precipitously.\nMr Tello said Mexican investments in Cuba to date totalled more than Dollars\n1bn and included joint ventures in tourism, textiles and cement. Another\njoint production agreement in glass manufacture will be finalised in two or\nthree weeks, Mr Tello said.\nMexico, a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), is one\nof Cuba's biggest trading partners in Latin America and has maintained\nstrong diplomatic and trade links with the island despite continuing US\nsanctions against the Cuban government.

    "document": "GORBACHEV APPEALS FOR WESTERN AID; NEXT 2 YEARS ARE CRUCIAL FOR SOVIET REFORMS, HE SAYS From Associated Press MOSCOW President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that his country needs Western \nassistance to make his reform program work, and he promised that any aid will \nbe repaid. Gorbachev spoke at a news conference after a day of meetings with Italian \nPremier Giulio Andreotti, the president of the European Community. Andreotti is \na leading proponent of providing aid to the Soviet Union. No agreements were reached in the talks about Italian or European aid to boost \nGorbachev's reform program. Gorbachev said the next two years of reforms will be crucial. \"In these two years, in which we will have to make the most difficult changes, \nwe need this kind of help,\" Gorbachev said. Some of the aid should be given quickly \"to reduce the difficulty of the \nproblems, and so perestroika does not slow down,\" he said. However, he added, the Soviet Union \"cannot depend on foreign sponsors\" to fix \nits economy but must depend largely on itself. Aid to his country will not be \n\"a handout,\" he said, but temporary assistance that must be paid back. Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union needs help producing more food and \nconsumer goods for the market and that factories need a chance to work with \nforeign firms to boost their productivity. As an example of Soviet inefficiency, Gorbachev has said 25% of the nation's \ncrops are lost during harvesting and storage. The president of the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union's largest republic, \ntoday warned of a food shortage \"catastrophe\" in Russia unless efficiency \nimproves. \"We have to gather it carefully, preserve it and get it onto the table of the \nRussian people,\" Boris N. Yeltsin said. \"The existing food situation in our republic is critical,\" he said in an appeal \non the front page of the Sovietskaya Rossia newspaper. \"To prevent a \ncatastrophe, we must improve it immediately.\" As an incentive, Yeltsin said the government will issue special coupons to \nagricultural workers, from farmers to tractor drivers, allowing them to buy \ngoods that have been in short supply. Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev warned in a separate interview that if the \nmarket is not soon saturated with food and consumer goods, \"the situation will \nbe unpredictable.\" \"The prices will simply skyrocket, and the shadow economy will capture \neverything,\" he told Pravitelstvenny Vestnik newspaper. The West German government has guaranteed $3.1 billion in bank loans to the \nSoviet Union, and together with France it pushed the European Community to \nendorse an immediate $15-billion aid program. But European leaders refused to go along with the plan, as did leaders of the \nworld's seven largest capitalist powers meeting in Texas earlier this month. President Bush says a program to provide the Soviet Union with Western advisers \nand know-how would be of greater benefit than economic aid until the Soviet \nUnion makes greater changes in its economy.

    "document": "MASKING THE HUMAN FACE The seeds of perestroika were sown in the Prague spring. It was there, 21 years \nago, that the socialism of the East first showed the world its human face. On Tuesday the government of Czechoslovakia will put playwright Vaclav Havel on \ntrial for the crime of remembering that fact. According to Czech authorities, the 52-year-old writer was guilty of \n\"incitement to a criminal act\" and \"obstructing public order\" when he took part \nin a demonstration marking the 20th anniversary of the death of Jan Palach, a \nPrague student who set himself on fire to protest the Soviet invasion that \nended his country's experiment in reform. If convicted, Havel could be \nimprisoned for 2 1/2 years. Eight of those who joined him in the demonstration \n-- leaders of various independent peace and human-rights groups -- are to be \ntried on other, equally specious, charges. Havel, Jana Petrova, spokesman for the Independent Peace Assn., and Ota \nVeverka, leader of the John Lennon Peace Club, have been jailed since their \narrest on Jan. 16. They were taken by police on the second of six days of \nprotest in which thousands of Czechs took part. Many of them suffered violence \nat the hands of the authorities; more than 1,400 were detained and released. Havel is one of those rare beings in whose spirit courage has arranged a \nmarriage of life and art. Two of his plays, \"A Private View\" and \"Largo \nDesolato,\" have been performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Times \ntheater critic Dan Sullivan recently described them as \"doleful, funny looks at \nthe way people adjust their principles to accommodate the political realities \nof the moment . . . . Havel's comedy is that of the tender conscience faced \nwith the tough choice and either making it or backing away.\" Backing away is precisely the accommodation that Havel has refused to make. \nThree times since 1968 he has endured prison in the cause of human rights. He \nwas an original signer of Charter 77, the citizens' initiative, and an early \nmember of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted. Last year \nhe signed \"Democracy for All,\" the manifesto of Czechoslovakia's new Movement \nfor Civil Liberties. He also serves on his country's Helsinki Watch Committee. Despite the relentless official harassment suffered by Havel the activist, \nHavel the artist has fashioned a unique body of work that is at once fully \nengaged and yet free of bitterness, propaganda or caricature. The thugs whose misrule passes for government in Czechoslovakia these days \nwould be ill advised to assume that they can deal with Havel and his courageous \ncolleagues as they will. The West knows and reveres Prague as the city of Kafka \nand Kundera, of Smetana and Dvorak, of Kosik and Patocka. The small men with \nthe frozen hearts who hold power there should not delude themselves into \nthinking that they can make Havel a forgotten casualty in what Arthur Miller \nrightly has called their \"war against the imagination.\" Editorial",

    "document": "FT  19 SEP 94 / Cuba acts to end chronic food shortfall By PASCAL FLETCHER HAVANA Cuba, moving to resolve chronic food shortages which have caused discontent\namong its population, will soon introduce markets where state farms and\nindividual farmers will be able to sell excess produce after fulfilling\nestablished government production quotas.\nThe weekend announcement of the change in policy was made by Cuban defence\nminister General Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel Castro and the\nnumber two in the ruling Cuban communist party hierarchy.\nThe announcement signalled another step in Cuba's cautious moves to\nintroduce limited market reforms to its centrally run state economy.\nThe changes are expected to follow the lines of similar farm reforms already\nintroduced by China and Vietnam. Gen Castro said solving the food crisis was\na priority for the government. While the agricultural markets would have\nregulations and taxes, 'supply and demand should basically operate', said\nGen Castro, saying the government would not involve itself in setting\nprices. Prices would in any case be much lower than those existing on the\nblack market, he said.\nThe production of food, especially staples like meat, rice, beans, fruit and\nvegetables, has been a particular black spot in the Cuban economy since the\ncollapse after 1990 of trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc.\nStarved of inputs like fertilisers, herbicides and tractor spares, farm\nproduction, including strategic sugar exports, has fallen sharply, a\nsituation made worse by adverse weather.\nOther factors were inefficiency, wastage of resources and lack of price\nincentives for farmers obliged to sell exclusively to the state, foreign\ndiplomats said.\nPopular pressure had grown for the liberalisation of food production, but\nthe topic was surrounded by agonised ideological debate at the highest\nlevels of the party.\nIn the first half of the 1980s, Cuba introduced a similar experiment with\nso-called 'peasants' markets' where farmers could sell vegetables, fruit,\npork and chicken.\nBut these were shut down after President Castro complained they led to the\nexcessive enrichment of some individuals, especially middlemen who bought\nand re-sold produce. Raul Castro's announcement was the first public\nacknowledgement that the farm reforms were imminent, but senior officials\nsaid more than 70 markets were already operating experimentally around the\nisland, excluding Havana city.\nOne such 'pilot' market was operating at San Nicolas de Bari in Havana\nprovince, where farmers at the weekend directly sold rice, avocado, bananas\nand yucca (manioc root) to the public.\nSince the 1960s, small private farmers have made commitments to sell\npreviously agreed upon quantities of produce each year to the government.

The expulsions, reportedly on CIA directions, were kept \nquiet by the Australian government, which is embarrassed at its \nimage as a soft target used by Moscow during and since the Cold \nWar. The expulsions were only exposed last month by an \nopposition MP. \n  A spy hunt is under way to identify a network of as many as \n30 Russian-recruited agents. The investigation was confirmed \nlast night in an interview with David Sadlier, Director-General \nof the Australian Secret Service. \n  Through its shared military and commercial operations with \nBritain and the United States, Australia is still considered to \nbe a more relaxed target for Russia to learn about its more \npowerful allies. The security breach could date back ten years, \nor possibly 30 years as the case of the last Soviet spy in \nAustralia, Vladimir Petrov, is reopened. A Russian translator \nwith the Australian secret service George Sadil, has been \ncommitted for trial in Canberra for handing over intelligence \nsecrets that would have been passed on to MI6 and the CIA. \n  Last night the programme Lateline offered the first specific \ndetails of Soviet penetration and damage. The targeting the \nlate 1980s was the joint Anglo-Australian development of the \nworlds most sophisticated sonar buoy for tracking Soviet \nsubmarine movements. The Barra sonar buoy was used by Britain in \nthe Atlantic and Australia in the Far East. \n  Developed in a project between Plessey and the Australian \ngovernment's Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the \nAustralian AWA defence manufacturer the buoy has 25 underwater \nhydrophones. They are dropped by RAF Nimrod surveillance \naircraft for the Royal Navy, and by Australian Air Force Orion \naircraft for the Australian Navy. \n  Disclosure of the operation was made by Professor Desmond \nBall, of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, at the \nAustralian National University in Canberra. \n  The focus of attention was the Garden Island Naval Dockyard \nbeside the Opera House. Professor Ball explained how Soviet \nagents intercepted phone calls between naval officers and \ndefence headquarters in Canberra, allowing Soviet agents to \nmonitor trials of the buoy by the naval facility south of Sydney.",

There was 'a united front' in the government, he said.\nHe sidestepped a question over whether he was one of the 14 junior ministers\nwhom Mr Edward Leigh, a former minister sacked in last month's reshuffle,\nhas indicated used to meet to discuss their unhappiness over Maastricht.\nThe interview followed Mr Forsyth's presence in the Lords on Monday during\nthe speech by Lady Thatcher, in which the former prime minister called again\nfor a Maastricht referendum.\nIn yesterday's debate, Lord Healey, the former Labour chancellor,\nhighlighted what he called the 'civil war' within the Conservative party,\nwarning it could 'poison Britain's political life' and 'corrupt the British\ngovernment's policy in every field.'\nHe found it 'particularly tragic' that Conservative infighting had 'played a\nmajor role in deepening the crisis in Yugoslavia.' Prime minister John\nMajor's failure to confront 'head on' the type of nationalism espoused by\nLady Thatcher had made the 'civil war in the government party a danger to\nBritain and to Europe as whole.'\nViscount Whitelaw, Lady Thatcher's former deputy prime minister, accused\nMaastricht opponents of taking 'a narrow-minded view' when a broader\napproach was needed 'in the interests of world peace.'\nHe told those demanding a referendum that parliamentary procedures had stood\nthe test of time and should not be changed on a 'short term, opportune\nbasis.'\nIn another strong speech supporting Maastricht, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff,\nthe former Labour prime minister, said the imperative that impelled the\ntreaty was 'the overriding necessity of preserving the peace and security of\nthe European mainland and hence the British Isles themselves.'\nBut Lord Tebbit, the arch Euro-sceptic and former chairman of the\nConservative party, attacked the treaty's proposed move towards monetary\nunion, saying the question that supporters of Maastricht needed to address\nwas whether a single currency was practical, whether it was achievable and\nwhether if achieved it would be in the EC's interests.\n'A single currency as chancellor Kohl has explained requires a single\ngovernment,' Lord Tebbit said.

[passage omitted] \n  According to figures from the Cyprus Federation Against \nCopyright Theft [CYFACT], the police have not been inactive \nsince January, having raided a total of 36 premises on receiving \ninformation that pirated material was on sale or for rent. \n  Only three weeks ago a video club in Xylotymbou village was \nraided and a total of 4,642 tapes were seized, together with 27 \nvideo recorders and 3 amplifiers which were being used for \ncopying. \n  CYFACT's legal adviser, Akhilleas Dimitradhis, said this \nweek \nthat five months after the implementation of the new copyright \nlaw, certain changes are obvious to all: \"We've seen a dramatic \ndecline in pirated products being offered for sale. The \nsouvenir shops and supermarkets which had given Cyprus such a \nbad reputation internationally appear to have taken the law \nseriously and have stopped selling illegal copies of films. In \nthe case of the video clubs, a number of them have conformed to \nthe provisions of the law, but there are still a few which are \nstubbornly refusing to do away with their pirated stock. It is \nhere that we are hoping that the police will vigorously enforce \nthe law.\" \n  Asked to suggest ways in which the situation could be \nimproved, Dimitriadhis noted that \"other than better \nenforcement\", the government's promised anti-piracy sticker \nguaranteeing a product's authenticity had still not \nmaterialised, whilst the question of classification and \ncensorship of video films still remains to be addressed. \n  It is estimated that only a third of the video clubs that \nflourished in the 1980's are still in business today. Although \noriginal videotapes are now being imported for sale and rental \n(some 3,500 titles are now officially on release in Cyprus, the \nofficial video release date in Greece applying here too), \nbusiness has been hit, ironically, by the rebirth of the cinema \nand the growing number of TV channels available. \n  Stricter regulations have put a stop to the huge export \nbusiness in pirated films, and the sales of blank tapes which \nreached almost 3.5 million in 1991 were down to 874,000 last \nyear. \n  This year figure is likely to be considerably lower. It is, \nof course, in the interest of the film companies that the video \nclubs and sales outlets remain in business, since the officially \nsanctioned home video market is a large and lucrative one, but \nthey are determined to stamp out once and for all the blatant \ntheft of their property.

For example, Direct Services Industries, Inc. stated that the ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;USFWS\nhas incorrectly determined that existing regulatory mechanisms are inadequate to assure conservation and recovery\nof the sturgeon and promote recovery of its purportedly declining population.'' They and other respondents also\nbelieve that operations at Libby Dam have not been modified to date because the biological needs and requirements\nof white sturgeon are not currently known. The IDFG also believes that recovery of the sturgeon population is still\nachievable without listing under the Act if the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) would modify Kootenai River flow\nmanagement to benefit sturgeon recruitment and survival. Service response: The Service believes that, although the lack of reproduction and successful recruitment is the most immediate threat\nto the sturgeon population, other factors are also contributing to their decline. In recent years, efforts by various\nState agencies and the Kootenai Tribe, authorized by the Northwest Power Planning Council (NWPPC) (1987) and funded\nby BPA, have been undertaken to identify all environmental factors limiting the white sturgeon population in the\nKootenai River. Additionally, the Corps and BPA have committed to providing experimental flows releases from Libby\nDam for sturgeon. For example, 400,000 acre-feet of water was released from Libby Dam during May and June 1993 as a test\nto stimulate sturgeon spawning. However, the experiment was intended only to evaluate possible spawning flow thresholds,\nnot to provide flow or habitat conditions necessary for survival beyond the egg stage throughout the spawning season. The Corps and BPA, in conjunction with the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), have also developed a flow proposal\nstarting in 1994 based on results of the 1993 experimental flow and water availability in an effort to provide for spawning\nand recruitment of Kootenai River white sturgeon. The flow proposal includes provisions to ``shape'' flows from\nLibby Dam to achieve the ``desired'' sturgeon flows in 3 out of every 10 years, dependent upon flow forecasts (water\navailability), and only to the extent that flows will not reduce refill or violate flood control requirements (Corps\n1993). Despite this flow proposal and cooperative monitoring efforts to better comprehend the factors affecting the Kootenai\nRiver white sturgeon, there is no long-term commitment to modify dam operations and manage stored water at other times\nof the year to ensure that sturgeon flows are provided starting in 1994 or other early years of the 10 year cycle. The\nCorps and BPA continue to prioritize Libby Dam operations to meet other demands, primarily hydropower and recreation,\nand not for the benefit of Kootenai River white sturgeon or other resident fishes.",

The \nauthorities had ordered the strictest security seen in five \nyears in the capital, sources said yesterday. China's leaders \nare on full alert against a possible uprising as the fifth \nanniversary of the 4 June, 1989, Tiananmen Square incident looms. \n  A special committee has been set up by the State Education \nCommission, the Beijing municipal party committee and district \nparty committees to deal with any sudden developments, sources \nclose to the Chinese authorities said. \n  There are strong signs of rising tension in the capital, \nwith \nthe People's Liberation Army (PLA) patrolling the streets and \nleaders nervous about a possible power struggle as paramount \nleader Deng Xiaoping's health declines. The sources said \nprotest marches and demonstrations planned for the 4 June \nanniversary were being forced underground by the clampdown. \n  The authorities have banned large gatherings in Beijing \nduring this sensitive period. A charity fund-raising campaign \nbeing organised by a group of Hong Kong businessmen to be held \nlater this week has had to be cancelled because of the emergency \norder. \n  The authorities fear that another upheaval like the \npro-democracy movement of 1989 could spark a power struggle, \nsources said. A source quoted a state leader's son as saying \nthat Deng Xiaoping had become a \"vegetable\" because of serious \nillness. \n  There have been strong rumours about Mr Deng's declining \nhealth since he appeared on Chinese Central Television earlier \nthis year looking dull. \"State leaders are living in a very \ntense atmosphere and are alert to every small change,\" the \nsource said. \n  Leaders fear, a power struggle when Mr Deng dies--a \nrepetition of what had happened after the death of the party \nchairman Mao Zedong. Meanwhile, high inflation and a large trade \ndeficit had put huge pressure on state leaders, he said. \n  \"Many Chinese officials wish that Deng Xiaoping could appear \nin public again to stabilise public feeling.\" On previous \nanniversaries of the crackdown, only armed police have been on \npatrol, a resident said. \n  But now PLA troops have been seen patrolling day and night \nin \nBeijing, including at Chang An Street, the main street and the \nlongest in the capital. Meanwhile, Beijing has sent a circular \nto institutions, urging citizens to be cautious in the \"serious\" \nperiod between 6 May and 10 June. \"Do not listen to the rumours \nof conspirators, do not gather around to watch in public areas, \ntreasure the present good and stable atmosphere that the \nopening-up policy has brought,\" it said.",
